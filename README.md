# About me

I have mixed experience of combining Information technology and supply chain. I am currently a
Microsoft Certified Azure Data Scientist Associate with high domain knowledge on supply chain
activities gained from both work and studies. I have the ability to analyse problems and translate
them into mathematical models and applications, thus predicting future events with machine learning
and with the ability to prescribe solutions with operations research and supply chain techniques.

# Projects

## [1_Operationalizing Machine Learning](https://github.com/Aduzona/Microsoft-Azure-ML-Projects/blob/master/1_Optimizing_an_ML_Pipeline_in_Azure)

In this project, I built and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

We seek to create and optimize an ML Pipeline using Bank Marketing dataset by:

* Optimize custom mdel with HyperDrive
* Optimize using Automated machine learning(AutoML)
And Compare the results of the 2 methods

## [2_Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)](https://github.com/Aduzona/Microsoft-Azure-ML-Projects/tree/master/2_Operationalizing_Machine_Learning)

This Project aimed at Operationalizing Machine Learning, by applying DevOps principles to Machine Learning, usually known as MLOPs. I will start by creating an ML model from the Bank Marketing dataset, from there I deploy the model, consume endpoint it and pipeline automation. it. 



## [3_Predicting mortality by heart failure using Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/Aduzona/Microsoft-Azure-ML-Projects/tree/master/3_Capstone_Project_Azure_ML_Engineer)

![Project Flow](images/0_capstone-diagram.png)

[Watch_Project_Demo](https://youtu.be/FyO7d5RUqPw)

I will start by getting the Heart failure dataset into Azure datastore, then create 2 models, one using AutoML and the other using HyperDrive,Compare there performance, Deploy Best Model and Test Model End Point.
