# [Operationalizing Machine Learning](https://github.com/Aduzona/Microsoft-Azure-ML-Projects/blob/master/1_Optimizing_an_ML_Pipeline_in_Azure)

In this project, I built and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

We seek to create and optimize an ML Pipeline using Bank Marketing dataset by:

* Optimize custom model with HyperDrive
* Optimize using Automated machine learning(AutoML)
And Compare the results of the 2 methods
